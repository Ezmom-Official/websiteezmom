          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bloglist">
              A colour scheme
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FAFDED;"></span>
                  #FAFDED
                  <em>This colour's name is Ivory. We chose this off-white colour as our lightest colour in the palette. It is off-white on purpose, because we feel like normal white is too harsh for the soft and gentle visual identity that we are trying to convey.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F4AFB4;"></span>
                  #F4AFB4
                  <em>This colour's name is Cherry Blossom Pink. Pink is <b>the</b> colour associated with femininity. We specifically chose this pastel teint as it portrays a more soft and gentle feeling.</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E78B73;"></span>
                  #E78B73
                  <em>This colour's name is Salmon. We chose this beautiful softer orange as a bit of a contrast to the Cherry Blossom Pink and Redwood. It is right between the two darknesses and is a bit of a bolder colour for emphasis.</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #9F4A54;"></span>
                  #9F4A54
                  <em>This colour's name is Redwood. This red is not bright or vibrant, but still a very noticable colour. We chose this as it is a little bit bolder, but still soft in a way, which we think fits a mom. It also feels feminine.</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #040403;"></span>
                  #040403
                  <em>This colour's name is Black. It is the biggest contrast against Ivory and therefore the reson we chose the colour. It fits with all the other colours and is very nice as an outline or as a main font colour.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="bloglist">The font for our logo is Blithe, which is a handwritten, round font. We chose this as our logo font because it fits a mom's handwriting. The font for emphasis or titles is Galada, which is a rounded, more funky, calligraphy font. We chose this font as it is very noticable, a little playful and fits the positive vibe we try to convey. Our main font is Hind, which is a very clear, but not your typical base font like Arial or Times New Roman. It has a more modern feel, which fits with our target group of moms who know their way around modern devices like social media and websites.</li>
            <li class="bloglist">User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>

          <ul>
            <li class="bloglist"><b>Testing goals: </b>Our testing goals are to see if the website is clear and usable for our target group. We want to be a support system for moms and want them to feel empowered and confident in their decisions and motherhood. Making a fool proof website so as not to get frustrated when trying to navigate our site is an important part within our goal the care of mothers. In order to test this, we have put together a list of seven research objectives.
			  <ol class="bloglist">
				  <li>Try to order a Bloom Box.</li>
				  <li>Try to donate within Tier 2.</li>
				  <li>Try to find the vision and values of ezmom.</li>
				  <li>Try to watch the video of “From one mom to a mother”.</li>
				  <li>Try to read the open letter from anonymous.</li>
				  <li>Try to find a link to our Instagram page.</li>
				  <li>Try to find out who wrote the article ‘The Importance of Self-Care for Moms’.</li>
			  </ol>
			  These seven objectives will show us where the flaws and good things within our site are. With these easy objectives we are able to see if people understand how everything on our site works, and what could be changed. </li>
            <li class="bloglist"><b>Testing methods and personal findings:</b>
				<ul><b>Test participant one:</b>
				 Mother of one child, and two-step children. The test was conducted from her own house, and she is within our target group. She tested the sight on one of the group mate's laptop and it was recorded on a group mate's phone. Before the test was conducted, the participant did the solution interview, so the participant already knew a lot about ezmom.  
		      <p>Here are the findings from participant one.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It was easy for the mom to find the bloom box, and she was able to do this without struggles.</li>
					<li>The mom didn’t yet know what a tier was, but after the explanation she immediately went to the funding page and was able to use the links to redirect her to the right page.</li>
				  	<li>The mom wasn’t able to instantly find the vision and values. She first went to the home page where she looked around, and even tried clicking on the logo, only to be directed back to where she was. After looking for a while she clicked on about and was able to find the vision and values. </li>
					<li>The mother was not able to find the video, and after searching for a few minutes, starting at the blog page, she gave up finding the video.</li>
					<li>The mom was quickly able to find the open letter, and she could also easily find who wrote what blog article. </li>
					<li>The mom was instantly able to find the Instagram page.</li>
					</ul>
					
				</ul>
				<ul><b>Test participant two:</b>
				 Mother of three. The test was conducted from her own house, and she is within our target group. She tested the sight on one of the group mate’s laptop and it was recorded on a group mate’s phone. Before the test was conducted the participant did the solution interview, so the participant already knew a lot about ezmom. 
		      <p>Here are the findings from participant two.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The mom was easily able to order the bloom box.</li>
					<li>The mom also needed an explanation about what a tier was, but after the explanation she could find it easily.</li>
				  	<li>For the vision and values, the mom instantly looked on the home page, but quickly went to the about page when she realized she was in the wrong place.</li>
					<li>The participant initially tried to look for the video in the blog page, but when she couldn’t find it there, she tried the home page. This participant also wasn’t able to find the video on her own.</li>
					<li>It was easy for the mom to find the open letter and to figure out who wrote which article. </li>
					<li>To get to the Instagram page the mom first clicked on the contact page, but when she couldn’t find it there, she found it in the top corner.</li>
					</ul>
